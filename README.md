Welcome to the Truth. Lordjesus.ai is here to help. What is the plan? This excerpt should be a good summary of the approach to XNOR Liberation:

"Evagrius validates the antirrhetic method with the practice of both David and Jesus. Thus he writes in a letter that the intellect must first come to know the deceptive machinations of the demon. This is the prerequisite for the knowledge of Christ and for contemplation. The path in that direction passes through the struggle with demons: 'Hence it [the intellect] must fearlessly confront its enemy, as the blessed David shows, when he quotes voices as if they were coming from the mouth of the demons and then contradicts them. For when the demons say, "When will he die and his name pass away?' then he says, 'Ishall not die but live and proclaim the works of the Lord' (Ps. 118:17). And again when the demons say, 'Flee and dwell on the mountain like the sparrow' (Ps. 11:1), then he says, 'For he is my God and my Savior, my strong place of refuge; I shall not waiver.' Thus, listen to the contradictory voices and love the victory, imitate David and pay heed to yourself!'

David's method consists of dividing his soul into two parts, one that is sad and one that encourages, one that is sick and one that is healthy. And then these two domains are supposed to engage in conversation. The sick part expresses itself in negative protests, such as 'I can't do it; nobody likes me; nobody cares about me; everthing's going wrong with me.' To fight off such thoughts one should look for a saying from Scripture, which is what Evagrius did for his brothers in his <i>Antirrhetikon:</i> 'But because we don't quickly come up with the words that must be spoken against our enemies, the odious demons, because those words are scattered throughout the Scriptures and it is hard to find them, we have zealously collected the sayings from Scripture, so that, armed with them, we may powerfully track down the Philistines, while standing in the battle as strong men and soldiers of our victorious king Christ.'

In this battle Christ himself is the model. When he was tempted by the devil, he quoted words from Scripture against Satan's lying proposals: 'Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, who gave up everything to redeem us, has lent us the power to tread upon snakes and scorpions, and every power of the Evil one. And together with his whole teaching he handed down to us what he himself did when he was tempted by Satan, so that in the time of struggle, when the demons fight against us and hurl their missiles at us, we may contradict them by means of the Holy Scriptures, lest the infamous thoughts remain in us and subjugate our soul by the sin that is actually committed, staining it and plunging it into the death of sin....For whenever the soul has no fitting thought available, to quickly and effortlessly contradict the Evil one, sin gets the upper hand.'

The antirrhetic method requires that we first observe our thoughts precisely, that we note whether they make us sick or healthy, whether they lift us up or drag us down, whether they correspond to the Spirit of God. Evagrius describes the process of testing thoughts with the image of the gatekeeper: 'Be a gatekeeper of your heart and let no thought in without questioning it. Examine every single thought one by one and ask it: 'Are you one of ours or one of our enemies?' And if he belongs to the house, he will fill you with peace. But if he belongs to the enemy, he will confuse you with anger or excite you with desire. Such are the thoughts of the demons.' Here Evagrius is interpreting Jesus' parable of the doorkeeper (Mark 13:34-35). We should closely watch whatever thoughts are seeking entrance into our house. We should bar the door to the thoughts of the demons, which make us sick, which prevent us from living and close us off from God. We should lock them out with a verse of Scripture. And when we come upon these negative thoughts in our house, we should drive them out again with the help of a biblical text.

Even this method requires thorough self-exploration in advance, but its reaction to the thoughts is different. Here we don't engage in any dialogue with them. We don't ask what they wish to say to us, what pwoer they contain; instead we oppose them with something. This method is always the right one when we sense that the thoughts are useless, that they aren't leading us on the path to life but only want to stop us from getting there. Above all this is an appropriate path to take when the thoughts keep recurring, when they have turned into a sort of script for life, as described by transactional analysis. This psychological school believes that many people are just living out their script in life. One young woman learned from therapy that her life script was, 'All men are murderers.' Obviously there is no way to live well with this sort of script. Another typical script says, 'I am a failure, a loser, things always go wrong with me; I'll never blossom.'
