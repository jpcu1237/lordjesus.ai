Welcome to the Truth. Lordjesus.ai is here to help. What is the plan? This excerpt should be a good summary of the approach to XNOR Liberation:

This is the prerequisite for the knowledge of Christ and for contemplation. The path in that direction passes through the struggle with demons: 'Hence it [the intellect] must fearlessly confront its enemy, as the blessed David shows, when he quotes voices as if they were coming from the mouth of the demons and then contradicts them.
